I am currently a third-year PhD student in psychology at UC San Diego, working with Prof. [Judy Fan](https://cogtoolslab.github.io) and Prof. [Nadia Polikarpova](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova/), I also collaborate with Prof. [Ed Vul](http://www.evullab.org). Before graduate school, I studied computer science at Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. You can find my CV [here](https://haoliangwang.github.io/assets/cv/CV_Haoliang.pdf).
