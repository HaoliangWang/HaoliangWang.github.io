Here are some organizations that I've been involved and/or lead.

## Pathways2AI

Pathways2AI is a new initiative at UC San Diego that aims to broaden participation in artificial intelligence (AI) and promote AI literacy for everyone. We partner with local K-12 schools to inspire students to see how relevant AI is to studentsâ€™ everyday lives, as well as how AI intersects with many other fields, including the arts, humanities, medicine, engineering, & law. This program is generously supported by National Science Foundation Award #2047191. Learn more about Pathways2AI: [https://pathways2ai.ucsd.edu/](https://pathways2ai.ucsd.edu/).
