title: "Hi there!"

I am a cognitive scientist studying **intuitive physics**.

We readily make physical predictions across a wide variety of scenarios in everyday life, from judging whether a Jenga tower will fall, to catching a baseball in the field. What are people's representation of the physical environment that enables them to do such general-purpose reasoning? My research uses tools from experimental psychology and computational modeling to address this question.

I am a postdoc at MIT, working with Prof. [Josh Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh). I obtained my Ph.D. in psychology from UC San Diego where I was advised by Prof. [Judy Fan](https://cogtoolslab.github.io). You can find my CV [here](https://haoliangwang.github.io/assets/cv/CV_Haoliang.pdf).
