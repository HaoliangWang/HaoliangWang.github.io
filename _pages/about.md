title: "Hi there!"
---

I am a fifth-year PhD student in psychology at UC San Diego. I'm currently looking for postdoc positions to study [intuitive physics](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(17)30126-2).

In order to interact with our environment, humans are continuously faced with the problem of making sense of the world. The capacity to formulate an explanation for our observations is a central part of human cognition. What are the underlying computations that enable humans to leap from sparse data to rich explanatory theories? My research uses tools from programming languages, deep learning and experimental psychology to adress this question, advance our understanding of the generative processes behind human intelligence, and build AI with common-sense reasoning.

I am primarily advised by Prof. [Judy Fan](https://cogtoolslab.github.io). I also work with Prof. [Ed Vul](http://www.evullab.org) and Prof. [Nadia Polikarpova](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova/). Before graduate school, I recieved my bachelor's degree in automation from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. I've also spent time as a research assistant at MIT, UCLA, CUHK and Chinese Academy of Sciences. You can find my CV [here](https://haoliangwang.github.io/assets/cv/CV_Haoliang.pdf).
